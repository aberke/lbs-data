# check that fake users do not travel impossibly far:
# We check that between two consecutive time intervals,
# synthetic users donâ€™t travel impossibly far; that is, they donâ€™t suddenly go 
# from one census area to another that is too far away to have been traveled within 
# that time interval. We can do this by looking at the geographic locations of the 
# centroids or the boundaries of census areas. We consider two consecutive stay locations 
# in a stay vector sequence as a bigram, and must verify that each bigram is sensible. 
# It is possible for sensible bigrams in the generated data to occur that have not been seen in 
# the training data. However, instead of verifying that all such bigrams are sensible, 
# we have a shortcut due to how well our RNN models are fit to our training data. 
# We are able to collect the set of bigrams in the real sequences, and the set of bigrams 
# in the synthetic sequences, and verify that only bigrams from the real sequences occur in 
# the synthetic sequences. If this is true, all the bigrams in our generated data must be sensible.
